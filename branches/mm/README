1. Introduction

You are an archaeologist trapped in an underground crypt with a limited supply
of air.  You must survive long enough to reach the crypt's exit.

    * Be too rash - and the arachnids will nibble you to death.
    * Be too wary - and your air supply will run out. 

Luckily, the ancients have left behind med packs, air cans and batteries in
the crypt - use them wisely!

2. Compilation

To build type: 

./configure && make

Pdcurses is the default on windows, ncurses is the default on all other 
platforms.  If you want to use pdcurses on linux, type:

./configure --with-pdc && make

Pdcurses will be downloaded as needed by the configure script.
