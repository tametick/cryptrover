Requires gcc, make and a curses compliant library.

Run 'make' if you want the default configuration (links to pdcurses on windows
and linux i686, ncurses on all other platforms). 

To cross compile for windows run 'make "C2WIN=1"' (uses mingw).

To compile with ncurses on linux i686 run 'make "NCURSES=1"'.

Run './cr' to play.
