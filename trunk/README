1. Introduction

You are an archaeologist trapped in an underground crypt with a limited supply
of air.  You must survive long enough to reach the crypt's exit.

    * Be too rash - and the arachnids will nibble you to death.
    * Be too wary - and your air supply will run out. 

Luckily, the ancients have left behind med packs, air cans and batteries in
the crypt - use them wisely!

2. Compilation

If you want to use the pdcurses version, make sure you have it in the lib
directory, either by running './getlibs.sh' or by downloading it yourself from
http://code.google.com/p/cryptrover/downloads/list?q=pdcurses

Run 'make' to build the default configuration (links to pdcurses on windows and
ncurses all other platforms).  To compile with pdcurses on linux, run 
'make "PDC=1"'.  Ncurses is not supported on windows due to its poor
performance on that platform.

To cross compile to windows run 'make "CROSS=1"' (requires mingw, on Debian
based systems run 'sudo apt-get install mingw32').
