IMPORTANT: Make sure Num Lock is on.

You are an archaeologist trapped in an underground crypt with a limited 
supply of air. You must survive long enough to reach the crypt's exit.

Be too rash - and the arachnids will nibble you to death. Be too wary - 
and your air supply will run out.

Luckily, the ancients have left behind med packs and air cans in the crypt 
- use them wisely!
