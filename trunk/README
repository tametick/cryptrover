1. Introduction

You are an archaeologist trapped in an underground crypt with a limited supply
of air.  You must survive long enough to reach the crypt's exit.

    * Be too rash - and the arachnids will nibble you to death.
    * Be too wary - and your air supply will run out. 

Luckily, the ancients have left behind med packs, air cans and batteries in
the crypt - use them wisely!

2. Compilation

The easiest way to compile cryptrover is to run the install.sh script, usually by typing './install.sh'.  If you don't want to use the install.sh script
(which will also download libraries as needed), continue reading.

Run 'make' to build the default configuration (links to pdcurses on windows and
ncurses all other platforms).  To compile with pdcurses on linux, run 
'make "PDC=1"'.

To cross compile to windows run 'make "CROSS=1"' (requires mingw, on Debian
based system run 'sudo apt-get install mingw32').

Make sure you have pdcurses in the lib directory, you can get it at:
