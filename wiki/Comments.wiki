 * Found a bug?

 * Are there too many/few enemies/power ups/levels? Is the game too easy/difficult? Too much/little hipoints/air? Power ups too powerful/weak? 

 * Have an idea for a new feature you would like to see?

If any of the above applies, or you have something else to say about the game, just leave a comment on this page.
